# MATLAB State-Flow & Simulink


## Stateflow/Simulink models for the following:
* Blinking LED    -  Simple example of achieveing concurrency in Simulink
* Fan Design  - FSM designed for a fan, with functioning Simple GUI.
* Vending Machine - More complex FSM with a functional GUI
* Raspberry Pi Led Test - FSM that can be ran on the Raspberry Pi via Simulink, will blink an LED ON/OFF.
